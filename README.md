# Cricket Score Predictor

Welcome to the Cricket Score Predictor project! This tool uses historical cricket match data to predict future match scores. Whether you're a cricket fan or a data enthusiast, this project offers a fun way to see how machine learning can forecast game outcomes.

## What It Does

This project leverages machine learning to estimate the scores of cricket matches based on past performance. It includes:

- **Data Collection**: Gathers and processes historical match data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates and refines features that improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Trains various machine learning models to predict scores.
- **Evaluation**: Tests and tunes the models to ensure reliable predictions.
- **Prediction**: Provides score forecasts based on new match details.

## How to Get Started

To set up and use the Cricket Score Predictor, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get a copy of the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-score-predictor.git
cd cricket-score-predictor
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's a good idea to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare the Data

Make sure you have the historical match data ready. Place it in the `data/` directory. Then, run the preprocessing script to clean and organize the data:

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```

### 5. Train the Model

Train the machine learning models with the prepared data:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 6. Evaluate the Model

Check how well the models are performing:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

### 7. Make Predictions

Predict future match scores by providing match details:

```bash
python predict_score.py --match-details "team1 vs team2 on date"
```
